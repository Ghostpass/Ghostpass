# ghostpass

Secrets manager cryptosystem that enables users to distribute sensitive secrets in plainsight with plausible deniability

## Introduction

__Ghostpass__ is a password management cryptography scheme that can hide encrypted secrets in cleartext for the purpose of distribution across public mediums. It is _novel_ in the sense that it combines modern symmetric cryptography with textual steganography and plausible deniability in order to address privacy. However, it should also be considered _novelty_ because it is __NOT__ a full replacement for current cryptographic software, but an ongoing effort to bridge together cryptography and privacy research. I encourage users to criticize, audit and expose shortcomings in order to better understand how these types of implementations can better be harnessed in the space of digital privacy.

### Why Ghostpass?

There's quite a bit of password managers that are out there today, so why even bother with Ghostpass? In order to answer this question, let's take a look at different password managers "models" that already exist, and the problems that plague them:

* __Web-based password managers__ are centralized, and data breaches are possible since they are central points of failure.
* __Offline clients__ ( i.e KeePass) don't enable for fast distribution across hosts and portability. They share a unified filetype that require compliant client implementations to work
