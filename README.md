# ghostpass

> WARNING: still WIP!

Ghostpass is a dead simple password management protocol that enables users to distribute cleartext-like ciphertext to the open web, while still maintaining security and data integrity.

## intro

There's quite a bit of password managers that are out there today, so why even bother with Ghostpass? In order to answer this question, let's take a look at several different password managers "models" that already exist, and the problems that plague them:

* __Web-based password managers__ are centralized, and data breeches because of undiscovered vulnerability results in catastrophic events.
* __Offline clients__ ( i.e KeePass) don't enable for fast distribution across hosts and portability. They share a unified filetype that require KeePass-compliant client implementations in order to open.
* __Deterministic password managers__, which are able to produce memory-less and session-less cryptographically secure passwords, fail because of varying password policies and the inability to keep state. Read more [here](https://tonyarcieri.com/4-fatal-flaws-in-deterministic-password-managers).

## install

With `pip` (TODO):

```
$ pip install ghostpass
```

Manually (use `virtualenv` for dev environment):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/ghostpass.git
$ cd ghostpass/
$ python setup.py install
```

## usage

```
Available Commands:

ghostpass help <command>
    - Prints help for a specific command

ghostpass init
    - Creates a new ghostpass session with master password
    - Pseudo-random ID created to identify session

ghostpass open <session>
    - Opens ghostpass session with master password
    - If only one session exists and session argument not provided,
    that is opened as default

ghostpass close
    - Closes ghostpass session, if any is opened
    - Changes should be STASHED to original session to save

ghostpass add <field>
    - Adds a new secret associated with <field> to current session

ghostpass remove <field>
    - Removes secret associated with <field> from current session

ghostpass view <field>
    - Shows unencrypted secret associated with <field> in current session

ghostpass stash
    - Commits changes made in opened session
    - Does not close session, but only writes changes to it

ghostpass list
    - Shows all sessions created by user

ghostpass secrets
    - Shows all fields and respective secrets in current session

ghostpass encrypt
    - Creates encrypted ciphertext with specified corpus of current session
    - Does not work independently

ghostpass decrypt <corpus> <ciphertext>
    - Decrypts specific ciphertext with corpus and master key
    - Works independent of whether user is in session or not

ghostpass destruct <session>
    - Destroys <session>
    - If only one session exists and session argument not provided,
    that is destructed as default

```

Example use case:

```
$ ghostpass init
$ ghostpass open <SESSION>
$ ghostpass add facebook
$ ghostpass stash
$ ghostpass close
```

## contribute

To create a new branch for contributions:

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/ghostpass
$ git checkout -b my-branch-name
$ # do code, do tests, etc etc
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Useful commit message"
$ git push origin my-branch-name
```

Of course, remember to `git fetch` for changes.

To setup a development environment:

```
$ pip install virutalenv
$ virtualenv env/
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
